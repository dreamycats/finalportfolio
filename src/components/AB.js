        <p style={{backgroundColor: 'aliceblue', alignSelf: 'flex-start', margin:'10px 50px'}}> A/B testing is a common technique used to evaluate an interfaceâ€™s performance by randomly
        presenting users version A and version B. Between these versions, data is collected and analyzed to
        test hypotheses, evaluate performance, and inform design changes or improvements to the experience.

   <p style={{backgroundColor: 'aliceblue', alignSelf: 'flex-start', margin:'10px 50px'}}> Here we created two bakery pages and used eye tracking technology to analyze which of the two sites allowed
   users to check out more seamlessly and quicker. Site A dedicated more space to names, while site B relied mostly on visuals.
   The results of our analysis proved that site B on the right hand side was
   obkectively a more user-friendly site. </p>

                <p style={{backgroundColor: 'aliceblue', alignSelf: 'flex-start', margin:'10px 50px'}}> Throough this project I familiarizd myself with a full iterative design process flow
                                    and took on a professional approach towards app design. I built upon on my wireframing and prototyping skills and
                                    practiced collaborative work in a design environment. I also became well acquainted with receiving and incorporating feedback from critiques and user testing trials
